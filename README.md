# Final Project Starter Repo

## Hydrology and Ecosystems 2

Materials for the EAES 420 Final Projects to be completed as a group. The group leader should generate a copy of this repo with a unique group name in the course org, then everyone else will fork it.

You will eventually replace this text with your Final Report / Executive Summary.

Your group's data comes from a network of sap flow sensors. Learn more about sap flow and the measurement from [this paper](https://paperpile.com/shared/sNx12Q2_cQM6Na8uawKLaMQ). Note that the name of the .csv files provides the location (uic = University of Illinois Chicago greenhouse; nu = Northwestern University; csu = Chicago State University), and it also contains the tree species name. Each observation contains a pair of measurements at two depths in the sap wood. And each dataset comes from a single tree.

## The Basics on Sap Flow

Sap flow is the flow of water through an outer layer of wood in a tree trunk, named the sap wood. Over the last few years, scientists have begun measuring sap flow using small, specialized sensors. The sensors consist of a set of three probes aligned vertically at two slightly different vertical heights. Heat is released from one central probe and radiates up and down towards the adjacent probes. The speed that the heat increase is detected at the other two probes is related to the upward flow of water in the sap wood (the sap flow).
